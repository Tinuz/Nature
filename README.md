# Welcome to Nature
### A blockchain project aiming to prevent wildlife crime 

Nature is the first blockchain project that aims to prevent wildlife crime, especially illegal wildlife trafficking. Beside preventing wildlife crime, Nature will be a crowdfunding platform to support animal charities. Nature's goal is to fight wildlife crime and to give animal charities the ability to raise funds beyond the borders of a city, state or country.
